		    <p>Dear Seattle City Council,</p>
		    <p>
			As you know, our state has the country's most regressive tax code, where poor people pay about seven times as much of their income in tax as wealthy people. Fortunately, Seattle is home to many successful companies that embrace creativity and innovation, presenting unique opportunity for alleviating the economic burdens faced by so many of our most vulnerable residents. Tapping into this potential is the spirit and intent of the Employee Hours Tax, which could generate $75M more in revenue for the city annually - 80% of which would go directly into securing affordable housing and 20% for human services. There is broad interest and support in Seattle's diverse business community to help create a more equitable city through an EHT and other progressive solutions.
		    </p>

		    <p>
			Recently the Progressive Revenue Task Force convened by the Council issued recommendations for implementing an EHT. Although we commend PRTF for their work establishing an important starting point to the conversation, many in our community feel certain aspects of the recommendations are inadequate to protect the local economy. However, we also also reject Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce's attempt to stonewall the entire conversation with a blanket "no" while using small businesses as a shield. We believe this to be an extremely manipulative approach to a critical social justice and equity issue.
		    </p>

		    <p>
The Chamber is denying an important reality in their opposition to an EHT: Seattle has a housing crisis that must be addressed. How are we to fund solutions? Property taxes are not an option because increases are already driving people out of the city. Income taxes are off the table for now because the courts overruled them. A regressive regional sales tax would disproportionately place the burden on the poor and working class yet again. A business tax is the only option left, and taxing only the larger businesses will reduce the impact of these taxes on the cost of living in Seattle. The Chamber is attempting to rush overburdened small business owners into opposition based on misinformation. This is disempowering to our community at best and exploitative at worst. An inclusively crafted EHT could actually benefit small businesses by supporting the low income housing that we, our customers, and our employees desperately need - at no cost to our businesses. Furthermore, securing more progressive tax policies creates space to move away from our current regressive policies- such as the burdensome B&O tax. 		    
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    As equal members of this community we feel our voices have been either left out, willfully manipulated, or misrepresented in this critical conversation. The signers of this letter support an Employee Hours Tax that will equalize the playing field for our city's most economically vulnerable, mitigate displacement, help preserve the cultural fiber of our neighborhoods, strengthen locally-rooted economy, and center humans and values over profits. We offer our support for an EHT with the following amendments that will ensure the protection of Seattle small businesses who are already experiencing burdens of taxation:
		    </p>

		    <ul>
			<li>Removing or making optional the so-called "skin-in-the-game" fee to lessen burden on lower-grossing small businesses. The final determination should be made transparently with equal democratically elected representation from SBAC and ACED in a public Business Roundtable.</li>
			<li>Significantly raising the threshold for exemption to the tax to shield local economy from negative impact. The final threshold must be determined transparently with democratically elected representation from SBAC and ACED as well as PRTF in a public Business Roundtable.</li>
			<li>Creating a process of application for other exemptions to protect against potentially negative impacts on local economy.</li>
			<li>Committing to a thorough review of how Seattle is currently spending money on housing and homelessness and creating an inclusive, transparent process for administering revenue earned from the tax to ensure a dollar-for-dollar increase in money put towards effective solutions. These new tax dollars should be spent in a extremely lean, direct method- inspired by how the best small businesses in this city run.</li>
		    </ul>

		    <p>
		    Thank you for your work on this issue. As small businesses and members of this community, we are ready and willing to contribute our fair share to solutions that will increase affordable housing. The revenue the EHT will generate is not enough, however. We urge you to also implement other progressive taxes to raise another $75 million in revenue, as suggested in Appendix D: a progressive estate tax, a surtax on excessive pay ratios, a REET mansion tax, and/or a tax on non-primary residences to deter vacant homes and speculative real estate investment. In support of an efficient, inclusive process that ensures full representation moving forward, we hope you will be responsive to our request to convene soon. To create a more equitable Seattle, time is of the essence.
