	    <h1>EHT Background</h1>

	    <p>
		In fall 2017, a <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/10/12/25468311/city-council-members-want-to-bring-back-the-employee-head-tax">proposal was put forward</A> by Councilmember Mike O'Brien and interim Councilmember Kirsten Harris-Talley to impose an "Employee Hours Tax" on large businesses to fund new housing, shelter, and services.  
		Although the measure fell in a 5-4 vote, on November 20th the council unanimously passed Resolution 31782.  
		This resolution expressed the council's intention to find new progressive revenues including an Employee Hours Tax, and to pass legislation in spring 2018 to "make investments with these revenues that would assist people who are homeless or at a high risk of becoming homeless in obtaining and retaining stable housing."

	    <h2>Progressive Revenue Task Force</h2>

	    <p>
		The City Council created a Progressive Revenue Task Force to study the issues and make recommendations.  
		Chaired by Councilmembers Lisa Herbold and Lorena González, the Task Force included representatives of several organizations in Housing For All, as well as other advocates, experts, and business owners.  
		After many meetings the Task Force unanimously recommended an Employee Hours Tax to raise $75 million per year, the top of the range they were asked to consider.  
		They recommended that 80% of the funding be used for housing and 20% for shelter and services, and that the tax be structured as equitably as possible so that very large businesses like Amazon - the ones that are benefitting most from our region's growth and can most afford it - will contribute most.

	    <h2>Why an Employee Hours Tax?</h2>

	    <p>
		Seattle doesn’t have many clear options when it comes to raising revenue.  Washington is one of just a handful of states with no income-based tax.  Instead, our state and local governments rely heavily on sales, property, and B&O taxes, leaving us with the <a href="https://itep.org/whopays/washington/">most regressive, most upside-down tax system in the whole country</a>.  Working and poor people pay up to 17% of their income in state and local taxes, while the wealthiest pay less than 3%. Smaller and low-margin businesses are hit disproportionately hard by B&O tax.  Levying an Employee Hours Tax on large businesses is the most progressive tax option the City has available right now. </p>

	    <div class="container">
	    <h2>Won’t this tax hurt small businesses?</h2>

	    <p>
		Under the first option proposed by the Task Force, businesses with gross revenue under $10 million would be exempt from the EHT.  However, the Task Force also recommended that businesses with revenue between $500,000 and $10 million be required to pay a flat fee of $200 to $400 per year.  This was called the “skin in the game” fee, and it has led to a misconception that small businesses would be required to pay $200-$400 <i>per employee</i>.  This is not the case.  However, ACED and many small business owners are advocating for the “skin in the game” fee idea to be dropped from the proposal, so that businesses with revenue under $10 million, or whatever the final threshold ends up being, will be entirely exempt.

	    <h2>Does the City really need new revenue?</h2>

	    <p>
		If you ask the Chamber of Commerce, they’ll say Seattle has plenty of revenue to fix the homelessness crisis, it’s just being misspent.  This is an absurd and irresponsible claim.  One main reason why thousands of people are homeless in Seattle and living on the streets is that there simply isn’t enough affordable housing.  Shelters and tiny house villages are full, and there is almost no permanent housing for people to move into.  For example, King County’s “Coordinated Entry” system has a waiting list of many thousands, but they are only placing single adults into housing at an average rate of 11 per month.  In Seattle alone, tens of thousands of additional units of housing are needed in the next ten years to meet the need, just for extremely low-income households.  Building housing costs money, there is no way around that.  Until the City builds housing on a large scale, the homelessness crisis will continue.  </p>
